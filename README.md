# A maturity model for embracing open source

A [maturity model](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/MaturityModel.html) is a tool to assess the effectiveness of behaviors, practices and processes in producing the desired outcomes. The model defines a set of structured levels that lead an organization down a path of more systematically organized and mature processes.

Embracing open source software is not a single act, but a series of steps, varying in complexity, that require unique knowledge and processes at each step. A maturity model for embracing open source software will guide an organization through steps of increasing complexity in adopting open source.

## Objectives

The maturity model will help organizations improve their performance of and capability to embrace open source in a way that improves their ability to deliver the products and services their customers want, when they want them and at a price they're willing to pay.

An organization applying the maturity model aims to:

- Produce higher quality products and service built on open source software components.
- Create value by using open source as a force multiplier, shifting limited resources from low-value work to high-value work, focusing on core competencies, and benefiting from the expertise of the community.
- Gain industry-wide recognition that serves as advertising, recruiting, or general leadership.

## Dimensions

1. Using open source software.
2. Contributing back to the open source projects you use.
3. Releasing your own software as open source.
4. Embracing open source as a strategy for producing better software.

Organization will have different questions and face unique challenges as they embrace more mature processes. Below are some of the questions that various people in an organization ask when for each type of activity.









## Potential applications of the Maturity Model

The maturity model is being developed with two primary goals in mind:

- Evaluating how our products, programs, services, and resources are helping customers develop more mature practices around open source.

- Creating a comprehensive _starter kit_ or [_field manual_](https://github.com/github/open-source/issues/94) that includes all the resources needed to use, contribute to, release, and manage open source projects on GitHub.

## Current Status

The maturity model is currently a very early concept and actively being developed.
